# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview 
the goal of this project is to support Tom, a colorado Board of Elections employee, in automating the vote-counting process for a local election. In helping tom, we have the current objectives: gathering the total number of votes cast, developing a full list of candididates who had recieved votes, uncovering the vote percentage each candidate had won, getting the total number of votes each candidate won, and finding the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

## resources
- Data source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.12, Visual Studio Code 1.67.2
- Final output: election_analysis.txt

## Election-Audit Results

  -   - Diana DeGette, who recieved 73.8%" of the vote with "272,892" number of votes.

## Election-Audit Summary
The code provided has paved a road to clearly represent the key objectives that were mentioned in the project overview. this code may have been created specifically for an election in Colorado but that does not limit its potential. The versatility in this code lies in the idea that in can be used in other state elections to provide each state's Board of Elections with important information on the election results. 
an adjustment that could be made to the code is to analyze the votes of all the States in America. This would be in the event that election audit is needed at the federal level; if the results of the presidential election were desired this would be a good use case. Further more, more detailed code could be provided in an effort tp gatherdata that reveals the percentage of votes from political parties, i.e. how many votes each candidate got that were republican, democrat or other.
